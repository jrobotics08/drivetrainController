This is our Vex V5 robots main code.

As of 2/21/25 the most updated version is "CompetitionDrivetrainController.cpp"

Controls:
  A: Reset intake motor
  L1: Release goal piston
  R1: Toggle goal piston

  downArrow: intake motor backwards
  upArrow: intake motor forwards

  btw the intake motor will constantly spin at the same velocity unless you give it an input, an input counts as any of the arrow buttons.

^Make sure you have the devices configured like this before you upload the code to the robot.

All you have to do is copy and paste the contents of "CompetitionDrivetrainController.cpp" into the vex v5 editor and then save it, and hit  upload then you should be good.

I think thats it tbh, if you need any help just let me know, goodluck with the competition!

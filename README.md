This is our Vex V5 robots main code.

As of 2/15/25 the most updated version is "CompetitionDrivetrainController.cpp"

This next section is for helping Levi:


If you need any help with anything code related just call me, if its not earlier than 7 ill prob answer

Controls:
  A: Toggles the specialized drivetrain mode(Levi drivetrain)
  B: toggles the piston 
  X: Toggles tank drivetrain
  Y: toggles arcade drivetrain

  downArrow: intake motor backwards
  upArrow: intake motor forwards
  leftArrow & rightArrow: both of these buttons reset the intake motor's speed

  btw the intake motor will constantly spin at the same velocity unless you give it an input, an input counts as any of the arrow buttons.

  The back buttons do nothing for the bot.

^Make sure you have the devices configured like this before you upload the code to the robot.

All you have to do is copy and paste the contents of "CompetitionDrivetrainController.cpp" into the vex v5 editor and then save it, and hit  upload then you should be good.

I think thats it tbh, if you need any help just let me know, goodluck with the competition!
